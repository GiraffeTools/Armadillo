# Armadillo
https://armadillo-brain.herokuapp.com
* Neuroimaging data often in 3D (Surfaces, Volumes, Tracts,...)
* Poster presentations always in 2D
* *Possible Solution*: Augmented Reality brains (ARmadillo)

####Features:
* Neurovault activation maps
* QR code to image specific web address...
* ...within the Augmented Reality marker, which is just a png/jpg.

# Example:
* Grab your phone
* Let the QR code direct you to https://armadillo-brain.herokuapp.com/neurovault/64604
  * (or go there yourself)
* Point your camera at the marker (on the next slide).
